## Case Exemple: 3D orientation in space

In this first exemple we will see how to use an ESP32 based PCB board with an speciffic sensor to obtain the 3D orientation in space

We will use an IMU sensor to obtain 3D orientation in a 3D space.

**Inertial Mass Unit (IMU)** sensor integrates:
- Gyroscope sensor: to measure the angular speed in X-Y-Z axes
- Accelerometer sensor: to measure the linear acceleration in X-Y-Z axes
- Compass sensor: to have a reference to the Geographical World
- A DMP microcontroller to process data and obtain its proper RPY 3-D orientation

This sensor is mounted on a PCB (Endo-module) with an ESP32 microprocessor to properly read the IMU sensor

**3D orientation**: there are differend methods to define the orientation. One of the most worldwide used is RPY with respect to World coordinate frame (WCF). This method defines:
- Roll: as a rotation across WCF x axis (corresponds to the Geographical North direction) 
- Pitch: as a rotation across WCF y axis
- Yaw: as a rotation across WCF z axis (corresponds to the Geographical Gravity direction)


### Hardware-Software setup
The **hardware setup** of this Lab session is based on:
- A "Robotics_UB" router: Assigning a fixed IP address to each module (x corresponds to group number)
  - SSID: Robotics_UB
  - Password: 
- Hardware modules:
  - PC control with roboDK program and python scripts (IP:192.168.1.x5)
  - Endo-module board with an ESP32 (IP:192.168.1.x2)

The **software setup** of the first prototype of the DaVinci surgery system is based on:
- Arduino program:
  - `Endowrist_IMU` folder: Arduino program for the Endo_module to obtain the 3D orientation
- RoboDK virtual environment: 
  - `3D_Orientation.rdk`: program in roboDK to visualize a 3D object orientation in a virtual environment 
- Python script programs:
    - `Read_from_Endo.py`: simple reads the RPY Endo-module data
    - `Receive_data_RPY_IMU_world.py`: python program to read the data from the Endo-module and send it to the 3D-orientation object in simulated roboDK program environment (3D_Orientation.rdk)
    - `Send_data_Endo_world_sim_sliders.py`: python program to send test orientation data with sliders to the computer with the same UDP wifi protocol as the ESP32 does.

### Laboratory session Tasks:

The proposed tasks for this first session are:
- Connect properly the Hardware setup
- Upload the `Endowrist_IMU` program to the Endo-module using PlatformIO. Take care about the proper IP address of Endo-module and PC corresponding to your group!.
![ESP32](././Images/3D_Orientation/VScode_platformIO.png)
- Run the `3D_Orientation.rdk` file in the roboDK program to visualize the UR5e robot arm and the Endowrist tool.
![rdk](././Images/3D_Orientation/3D_Orientation_final.png)
- Run the `Receive_data_RPY_IMU_world.py` python program and review the corresponding orientation obtained in the 3D object selectes in roboDK. Take care about the proper Endo-module corresponding to your group!
![python](././Images/3D_Orientation/VScode_python.png)

- Is the `plane` 3D object in roboDK moving properly?
- What you have made to properly verify the orientation angles Roll, Pitch and Yaw?
- Change the 3D object orientation to "surgical_needle". What you have to change in the python code?

### Laboratory session delivery

To develop the task delivery for this seminar you have to:
- install in your labtop:
  - Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
  - git: https://git-scm.com/install/
  - python 3.11 version
  - in VScode terminal install robodk library:
    ````python
    python -m pip install robodk
    ````
- Emulate what you have made in Seminar lab session:
  - Execute `3D_Orientation.rdk` program to visualize a 3D object orientation in a virtual environment
  - Execute the python program `Send_data_Endo_world_sim_sliders.py` to emulate the `Endo module` you have used in Seminar lab session
  - Execute the python program `Receive_data_RPY_IMU_world.py` to read the data from the emulated Endo-module and perform the 3D-object orientation in `3D_Orientation.rdk` roboDK program environment
  - Review 
- You will have to create a new `3_LabProject_Delivery.md` markdown document including a short description of:
  - what you have done
  - how you have proceed with the questions we suggest in last section
  - your final conclusions including a discussion on how you can use these tools in your `avant-projecte` or also in your `TFG` or future engineering projects.
